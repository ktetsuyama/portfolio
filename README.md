## Introduction
I created this portfolio to showcase my projects and code samples.

## Problem

I am a budding full stack developer that wishes to show off the work that I have done so far in my career, but don't have an application to do so.

## Solution

 I created a portfolio application that is coded well on its own, but also showcases a selection of projects that I have worked. It can be easily updated in the future.

## Credits

I collaborated with George Schultz, Aster Oliva, Ailleen Nguyen, and Nick Gambino to troubleshoot any bugs that I had during development of this application.
